### Rustacean & Autodidact. ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lorenzo, and below you'll find a bit more about me, and my journey as a software engineer.

I got my start in my spare time, circa 2017, after realizing that I could transfer my understanding of computers from audio-engineering, into other technical fields. 

My path since has been rather unique: I graduated from [BloomTech](https://www.credly.com/badges/179968c7-0dd9-473c-bdbd-34919b83d33b/public_url) August 24th, 2020, and then went on to be a team lead for the Computer Science & Backend portion of the curriculum, helping them refine their understanding of recursion, time complexity, various search algorithms, Node/Express, SQL and asynchronous programming. 

Shortly thereafter, out of a newfound passion for the fields, I began publicly self-teaching Math ([1](https://twitter.com/Yliastrum/status/1350624662217056257?s=20), [2](https://overoxidize.github.io/textbook-notes/math-textbooks/linear-algebra-done-right/proof-of-subspaces/)), ([Astro](https://nextjournal.com/0xledev/computing-galactic-orbits-with-astropy-a-data-driven-ride-through-the-cosmos?token=YUfQGTMz3Bvm1qCyP1xx9C))/Physics ([1](https://twitter.com/Yliastrum/status/1358258296671539200?s=20), [2](https://twitter.com/Yliastrum/status/1456383068525285384?s=20)) from scratch, posting notes, articles ([1](https://interintellect.medium.com/a-brief-introduction-to-time-in-physics-d731162fc813), [2](https://digigard.hashnode.dev/on-dirac-glory-from-perseverance)) and doing salons for the Interintellect ([1](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quantum-computing-1-history-plank-turings-brainchild-ii-salon-tickets-136265747519), [2](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-quantum-race-how-it-all-began-interintellect-salon-tickets-140255308403)), and podcasts ([1](https://youtu.be/PPGR49bWRyE), [2](https://youtu.be/gQxz6Yp62Zk)), before finally deciding to return heavily to programming, with Rust.

Currently I'm participating in the Summer 1 batch of @recursecenter.

Current WIP projects: 

- [Rustirc](https://github.com/overoxidize/rustirc), an IRC implementation written in, you guessed it, Rust.
- [chemicli](https://github.com/overoxidize/chemicli/builder-api), a command line app for querying the periodic table of elements.
- [patina](https://github.com/overoxidize/patina), an API for a cryptocurrency and currency exchange aggregator.
- [conversus](https://github.com/lorenzoevans/conversus), a desktop application for 'phototopical' discussion. Phototopical means conversation based on a (textless) image.
